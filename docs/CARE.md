# CARE System: Summary of Key Decisions

## 1. CARE Attributes

Curiosity (C), Agency (A), Resilience (R), Empathy (E) define the capabilities of both characters and monsters, forming the foundation of engagement and combat mechanics.

### Characters

- CARE attributes represent strengths and weaknesses.
- Players start with one strong attribute and weaker others, driving growth and adaptation.
- Attributes determine success in skill checks and interactions with monsters.

### Monsters

- Each monster has CARE resistances corresponding to its type, which dictate how hard it is to overcome using specific attributes:
  - Guardians: High Resilience.
  - Orphans: High Empathy.
  - Demons: High Agency and Curiosity.

## 2. Engagement and Disengagement

### Engagement Rules

- Once engaged, characters cannot leave the zone until they:
  1. Defeat a monster (reduce its primary resistance to 0).
  2. Make a successful Agency check to disengage.

### Engagement Progression

- To engage an Orphan or Treasure, players must first overcome or disengage from Guardians or Demons.

### Failure Consequences

- If all a character’s attributes drop to zero:
  - All companions (Soldiers, Children) are lost.
  - Any Treasure Points in the zone are forfeited.

## 3. CARE Cascading Bonuses

When a player makes a successful check against a monster’s zeroed attribute, they gain a +1 bonus to a related attribute on their next turn. The reverse CARE flow ensures a thematic and strategic progression:

1. Empathy (E) → Resilience (R):
   - Understanding others fosters inner strength.
2. Resilience (R) → Agency (A):
   - Perseverance empowers decisive action.
3. Agency (A) → Curiosity (C):
   - Bold action opens doors to insight.
4. Curiosity (C) → Empathy (E):
   - Insight deepens connection and empathy.

## 4. Healing Mechanics

To balance the risks of engagement, healing is limited but meaningful:

1. Victory Healing:
   - Defeating a monster restores 1 point to any attribute.
2. Treasure Healing:
   - Spending 1 Treasure Point outside combat restores 2 points total across attributes.

## 5. Combat Mechanics

### Skill Checks

- Players roll d6 + relevant attribute against the monster’s resistance.
- Success reduces the monster’s resistance by 1.
- Failure increases the monster’s resistance by 1 and can escalate the encounter.

### Monster Attributes and Roles

- Guardians: High Resilience, block access to other entities.
- Orphans: High Empathy, convert to Children for Curiosity bonuses.
- Demons: High Agency or Curiosity, escalate encounters and guard Treasure.

## 6. Player Progression

### Companions

- Soldiers (from Guardians): Boost Resilience.
- Children (from Orphans): Boost Curiosity.

### Treasure Points

- Upgrade attributes.
- Heal during rest phases.
- Serve as rewards for defeating Demons.

This summary consolidates the strategic depth and simplicity of the CARE system, making it a robust and engaging framework for gameplay. Shall we refine or expand on any particular aspect?
