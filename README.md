# Orphans-N-Guardians

[ONG](https://ihack.us/2024/11/29/kickstarter-pitch-orphans-guardians-the-quest-for-your-true-self/)
is a role-playing game for teaching "parts work", a therapeutic technique for
understanding and managing internal conflict. The game is designed to be played
by a group of 1-6 players, using software as the facilitator. The facilitator
guides the players through a series of encounters with their "orphans" (parts of
themselves that are stuck in the past) and "guardians" (parts of themselves that
protect them from their orphans). The goal of the game is to help players
identify and understand their orphans and guardians, and to learn how to work
with them in a healthy and productive way.
